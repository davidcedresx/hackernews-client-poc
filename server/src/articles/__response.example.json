For example, if someone wanted to control 50% of the masternode network, they would have to buy 4,800,000 DASH from the open market. This would raise the price substantially and it would become impossible to acquire the needed DASH.\u003cp\u003eOh my god\u003cp\u003e\u0026gt; Bad actors could also run masternodes, but not provide any of the quality service that is required of the rest of the network. To reduce the possibility of people using the system to their advantage \u003cem\u003enodes\u003c/em\u003e must ping the rest of the network to ensure they remain active.\u003cp\u003eOh my goddddd\u003cp\u003eNobody making this has any clue about distributed systems, do they",
